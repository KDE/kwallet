This directory consists of one daemon: kwalletd, and one library, in backend.

KWallet::Backend is used inside kwalletd to manage the actual files and
encryption.

KWallet::Wallet, used to represent wallet entries and to encapsulate communication
to and from the wallet server kwalletd, is part of the public API and has been
moved to kdeui.
