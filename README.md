# KWallet Framework

Safe desktop-wide storage for passwords

## Introduction

This framework contains two main components:
* Interface to KWallet, the safe desktop-wide storage for passwords on KDE work 
spaces.
* The kwalletd used to safely store the passwords on KDE work spaces.

The library can be built alone, without kwalletd, by setting the
`BUILD_KWALLETD` option to `OFF`.
