# KWallet Framework

Safe desktop-wide storage for passwords

## Introduction

This framework contains two main components:
* Interface to KWallet, the safe desktop-wide storage for passwords on KDE work 
spaces.
* The kwalletd used to safely store the passwords on KDE work spaces.

If the option KF5_KWALLET_NO_DAEMON is found when building, kwalletd and the 
associated tests will not be built nor installed.
